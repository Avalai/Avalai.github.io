Do you use GitHub Pages? It's a pretty convenient feature. Most of the big git repository-hosting services now offer a similar feature, which is nice. My current favourite is GitLab Pages, but don't let that put you off - all options are worth exploring!

In this GitHub Pages site, you can find:
- My work experience
- My education experience
- Some tidbits about my personality and life
- Maybe some useful information?

If you're interested in chatting, feel free to contact me through the methods listed on the site. See you around! ðŸ¦„
